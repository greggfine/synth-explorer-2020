        <h2>About</h2> 
        <p>We have one single goal in mind: to make you a satisfied synth explorer.
        That single focus, driven from every aspect of the company's operation, is the key to our ongoing success. If you're a
        satisfied synth lover, you'll come back to us when you have additional questions in the future, and you'll tell your
        friends about us. Then if we can make them satisfied synth-enthusiasts, the cycle continues.</p>
        <p>It seems so simple: just make your visitors happy!
        In fact it takes a lot of hard work to make it happen â€” but not everyone is willing to make that effort. That very
        simple concept is the reason Synth Explorer was founded in the first place. Since 1970, we've
        committed to "doing the right thing", and this belief is at the core of Synth Explorer's identity, ethics, and practice.</p>
