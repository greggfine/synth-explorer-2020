While it predated MIDI implementation by several years, it does have CV input for control of the VCA or filter cutoff. ",

VCO1 is switchable between any combination of triangle, sawtooth, pulse, and square waves and can be switched between 4 octaves. VCO2 has the same options, except the square wave is replaced by a noise generator switch and it has a 6 octave range, with an octave above and below VCO1's range.",

It had some pretty amazing features for its time such as eight voice polyphony, patch memory storage and polyphonic aftertouch. It can generate great analog strings, brass, drones and pads with that instantly recognizable classic polysynth sound. No synth sounds greater. Some examples of its extremely fat sound can be heard in 'Blade Runner' and 'Mutiny on the Bounty' by Vangelis as well as 'Dune' by Toto. ",

Prior to the Minimoog, synthesizers were custom built to order, and required a great deal of technical knowledge to be able to wire up and create a sound.",

Also added to the Wave series was an onboard sequencer that is capable of recording filtering and wavetable changes in realtime.",
